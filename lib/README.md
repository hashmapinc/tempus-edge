# Tempus Edge Library
This folder is home to the source code for all shared Tempus Edge components.

If your source code is not application-specific, consider placing it here for reuse by other edge applications.

# Golang note:
Make sure you add `<full-path>/tempus-edge/lib/go` to your `GOPATH` environment variable so the go compiler will have access to the library.
